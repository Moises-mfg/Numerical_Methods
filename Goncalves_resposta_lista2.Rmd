# Questão 1 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#require(ggplot2)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(35)

#creating variables 
beta = 0.987 # intertemporal discount rate (discrete time)

mu = 2 # risk aversion

alpha = 1/3 # income of labor/ toal income 

delta = 0.012 # depreciation rate 

rho = 0.95 # persistence of the previous shock

sigma = 0.007 # variance of the white error of the shock

toler = 10^(-5)

k_ss = (1/(alpha*beta) - (1-delta)/alpha)^(1/(alpha-1))
```

```{r}
#Tauchen function



```

```{r}
# Question 3
# Iteration of the value function

#Create grid for capital 

# what is the k_ss?

V0 = 0 # initia guess

k_grid = seq(from= 0.75*k_ss, to=1.25*k_ss, length.out = 500)
